_Topic: **Intelligent Course-Aware IDE** (4)_

Traditional coding environments focus primarily on programming tasks, requiring students to switch between multiple tools for lecture notes, assignments, and discussions. This fragmented approach disrupts the learning process, making it difficult to connect theoretical concepts with practical coding exercises. Additionally, students often struggle with organizing course materials, revisiting key concepts, and efficiently reviewing content.

Your task is to design and implement a course-aware IDE that integrates coding with learning resources. The IDE should allow students to manage course materials, take notes, execute code snippets in slides, take exercises, learn from examples, and track progress within a unified environment. This tool could be a standalone application or a plugin/extension for existing IDEs. The goal is to transform how students engage with programming courses by making lectures more interactive, learning more intuitive, and collaboration seamless.

Here are some directions you may explore:

- **Intuitive Course Resource Management**: Provides a structured interface for organizing course materials. Users can take digital notes directly within the IDE, bookmark key concepts, and link resources to coding exercises for easy reference.

- **Code-Linked Lecture Execution**: Lecture slides are embedded within the IDE, allowing students to modify and execute code snippets inline. This feature enables real-time experimentation with lecture examples and immediate feedback on code correctness.

- **Collaborative Coding & Resource Sharing**: Supports real-time collaborative coding, discussion threads linked to lecture content, resource sharing among students, and built-in chat for team projects.

- **Course Progress Tracking**: Tracks student progress through the course materials, showing completed tasks, upcoming assignments, and contents needing attention.

- **AI Learning Assistant**: Summarizes lecture content, highlights key takeaways, generates mind map or flow charts for visualization, and creates quizzes for self-assessment with auto-grading and explanations.
